This addition is designed to reduce droplet spread, but this also changes the nature of these devices, and may alter the amount of oxygen delivered to a patient. This research investigated how placing a surgical face mask over both a simple plastic mask (\"Hudson mask\") and nasal cannula altered the concentration of available oxygen measured at the nares.\nWe measured the inspired and end-tidal oxygen concentrations of five healthy non-smoking volunteers. Oxygen was delivered via nasal cannula and also a simple plastic face mask, at flow rates of 2, 4, 6 and 8 l per minute, with and without an overlying surgical face mask.\nAdding a surgical mask over nasal cannula caused an appreciable rise in the end-tidal oxygen concentrations at all the measured oxygen flow rates 2, 4, 6, 8 L\/minute. With the Hudson mask, there was a rise in oxygen concentration at 4 and 6 L\/minute. For example, at a flow rate of 4 l\/min via nasal cannula, available oxygen concentration increased from 24 to 36%, and via the Hudson mask the concentration rose from 27 to 38%.\nThe addition of a surgical face mask over both nasal cannula and a Hudson mask resulted in an increased available oxygen concentration. This may be valuable where more advanced oxygen devices are not available, or alternatively providing adequate supplemental oxygen at lower flow rates and thus making critical savings in oxygen usage.\n","title":"The application of a surgical face mask over different oxygen delivery devices; a crossover study of measured end-tidal oxygen concentrations.","url":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/35255824\/"}
